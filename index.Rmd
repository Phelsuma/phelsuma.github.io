I am passionate about ecology and wildlife conservation, focusing my interests using data science & visualization with tools such as R and QGIS. In my spare time, I enjoy wildlife photography & exploring in 4-wheel drive, with some of my favorite places being the Chiricahuas & the Simpson Desert. I am currently based out of California, USA.
